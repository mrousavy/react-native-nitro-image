**Nitro Image** is a superfast Image core type and view component for React Native, built with Nitro!

- Powered by [Nitro Modules](https://nitro.margelo.com) for highly efficient native bindings! üî•
- Instance-based `Image` type with byte-buffer pixel data access üîó
- Supports in-memory image operations like resizing and cropping without saving to file üìê
- Supports deferred `ImageLoader` types to optimize for displaying large lists of Images ‚è≥
- Fast Web Image loading and caching using [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage) (iOS) and [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) (Android) üåé
- [ThumbHash](https://github.com/evanw/thumbhash) support for elegant placeholders üñºÔ∏è

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <NitroAsyncImage
      image={{ filePath: '/tmp/image.jpg' }}
      style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}
    />
  )
}
```

## Installation

Install [react-native-nitro-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-nitro-image) from npm:

```sh
npm i react-native-nitro-image
npm i react-native-nitro-modules
cd ios && pod install
```

> [!NOTE]
> Since NitroImage is built with [Nitro Views](https://nitro.margelo.com/docs/hybrid-views), it requires the [new architecture](https://reactnative.dev/architecture/landing-page) to be enabled.

Then, since [SDWebImage does not enable modular headers](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage?tab=readme-ov-file#swift-and-static-framework) for static linkage, you need to enable those yourself **in your app's `Podfile`**:

```rb
target '‚Ä¶' do
  config = use_native_modules!

  # Add this line:
  pod 'SDWebImage', :modular_headers => true
```

## Usage

### Creating `Image`s

There are numerous ways to create an `Image` through the `Images` factory:

```ts
const webImage      = await Images.loadFromURLAsync('https://picsum.photos/seed/123/400')
const fileImage     = await Images.loadFromFileAsync('file://my-image.jpg')
const resourceImage = Images.loadFromResources('my-resource.jpg')
const symbolImage   = Images.loadFromSymbol('star')
```

#### Load with Options

When loading from a remote URL, you can tweak options such as `priority`:

```ts
const image1 = await Images.loadFromURLAsync(URL1, { priority: 'low' })
const image2 = await Images.loadFromURLAsync(URL2, { priority: 'high' })
```

#### `ArrayBuffer`

The `Image` type can be converted to- and from- an `ArrayBuffer`, which gives you access to the raw pixel data in ARGB format:

```ts
const webImage        = await Images.loadFromURLAsync('https://picsum.photos/seed/123/400')
const arrayBuffer     = await webImage.toArrayBufferAsync()
const sameImageCopied = await Images.loadFromArrayBufferAsync(arrayBuffer)
```

#### Resizing

An `Image` can be resized entirely in-memory, without ever writing to- or reading from- a file:

```ts
const webImage = await Images.loadFromURLAsync('https://picsum.photos/seed/123/400')
const smaller  = await webImage.resizeAsync(200, 200)
```

#### Cropping

An `Image` can be cropped entirely in-memory, without ever writing to- or reading from- a file:

```ts
const webImage = await Images.loadFromURLAsync('https://picsum.photos/seed/123/400')
const smaller  = await webImage.cropAsync(100, 100, 50, 50)
```

#### Saving

An in-memory `Image` object can also be written/saved to a file:

```ts
const smaller  = ...
const path     = await smaller.saveToTemporaryFileAsync('jpg', 90)
```

### Hooks

#### The `useImage()` hook

The `useImage()` hook asynchronously loads an `Image` from the given source and returns it as a React state:

```tsx
function App() {
  const image = useImage({ filePath: '/tmp/image.jpg' })
  return ‚Ä¶
}
```

#### The `useImageLoader()` hook

The `useImageLoader()` hook creates an asynchronous `ImageLoader` which can be passed to a `<NitroAsyncImage />` view to defer image loading:

```tsx
function App() {
  const loader = useImageLoader({ filePath: '/tmp/image.jpg' })
  return (
    <NitroAsyncImage
      image={loader}
      style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}
    />
  )
}
```

### The `<NitroImage />` view

The `<NitroImage />` view is a native Nitro View component for rendering an `Image` instance:

```tsx
function App() {
  const image = ‚Ä¶
  return (
    <NitroImage
      image={image}
      style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}
    />
  )
}
```

### The `<NitroAsyncImage />` view

The `<NitroAsyncImage />` view is a JS-based view that simplifies image rendering - it just uses `<NitroImage />` under the hood:

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <NitroAsyncImage
      image={{ filePath: '/tmp/image.jpg' }}
      style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}
    />
  )
}
```

### The `<NitroWebImage />` view

The `<NitroWebImage />` view is a JS-based React Native view component that fetches an `Image` from a remote URL as soon as it is mounted and displays it:

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <NitroWebImage
      url="https://picsum.photos/seed/123/400"
      placeholder={{ thumbHash: '‚Ä¶' }}
      options={{ priority: 'high' }}
      style={{ width: 400, height: 400 }}
    />
  )
}
```

#### Dynamic width or height

To achieve a dynamic width or height calculation, you can use the `image`'s dimensions:

```tsx
function App() {
  const image = useImage({ filePath: '/tmp/image.jpg' })
  const aspect = (image?.width ?? 1) / (image?.height ?? 1)
  return (
    <NitroImage
      image={image}
      style={{ width: '100%', aspectRatio: aspect }}
    />
  )
}
```

This will now resize the `height` dimension to match the same aspect ratio as the `image` - in this case it will be 1:1 since the image is 400x400.

If the `image` is 400x200, the `height` of the view will be **half** of the `width` of the view, i.e. a 0.5 aspect ratio.

### ThumbHash

A ThumbHash is a short binary (or base64 string) representation of a blurry image.
Since it is a very small buffer (or base64 string), it can be added to a payload (like a `user` object in your database) to immediately display an image placeholder while the actual image loads.

<details>
  <summary>Usage Example</summary>


  For example, your `users` database could have a `users.profile_picture_url` field which you use to asynchronously load the web Image, and a `users.profile_picture_thumbhash` field which contains the ThumbHash buffer (or base64 string) which you can display on-device immediately.

  - `users`
    - `users.profile_picture_url`: Load asynchronously
    - `users.profile_picture_thumbhash`: Decode & Display immediately

  Everytime you upload a new profile picture for the user, you should encode the image to a new ThumbHash again and update the `users.profile_picture_thumbhash` field. This should ideally happen on your backend, but can also be performed on-device if needed.
</details>

#### ThumbHash (`ArrayBuffer`) <> Image

NitroImage supports conversion from- and to- [ThumbHash](https://github.com/evanw/thumbhash) representations out of the box.

For performance reasons, a ThumbHash is represented as an `ArrayBuffer`.

```ts
const thumbHash      = // from server
const image          = loadImageFromThumbHash(thumbHash)
const thumbHashAgain = image.toThumbHash()
```

##### ThumbHash (`ArrayBuffer`) <> Base64 String

If your ThumbHash is a `string`, convert it to an `ArrayBuffer` first, since this is more efficient:

```ts
const thumbHashBase64      = // from server
const thumbHashArrayBuffer = thumbHashFromBase64String(thumbHashBase64)
const thumbHashBase64Again = thumbHashToBase64String(thumbHashArrayBuffer)
```

##### Async ThumbHash

Since ThumbHash decoding or encoding can be a slow process, you should consider using the async methods instead:

```ts
const thumbHash      = // from server
const image          = await loadImageFromThumbHashAsync(thumbHash)
const thumbHashAgain = await image.toThumbHash()
```
